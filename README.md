# Homework 1: Writing Specifications with Hypothesis

There are three parts to this homework.

- The first part is a series of small, mini-exercises. The exercises are designed to help you get used to the Hypothesis syntax, and are organized by concept (assertions, safety properties, preconditions, etc.).
<!-- TODO update -->

- The second part gives you a medium-size Python program and asks you to find all the bugs in it, using Hypothesis. There are 5 bugs for you to find. You should commit changes for all the 5 bugs, but you should also commit all tests you used to help find them.

- The third part is an open-ended task to implement your own program, and to write tests for it. In addition, you will be asked to write "wrong" versions of every function and show that they fail the unit tests.

To get started, [make sure you have completed Homework 0](https://github.com/DavisPL-Teaching/189c-hw0);
in particular, you should have Python, Hypothesis, and Pytest installed.
Then open and edit the files `part1.py`, `part2.py`, and `part3.py`.
To run the code, you can use
```
pytest part1.py
pytest part2.py
pytest part3.py
```
